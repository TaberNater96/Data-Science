This project delved into NASA's meteorite dataset, uncovering unique insights into global meteorite characteristics, especially ancient, larger relict meteorites found mainly near Earth's poles. It highlighted how certain environmental conditions foster preservation, minimizing erosion. An advanced XGBoost Regression model was developed to predict future meteorite impacts with very high accuracy, showcasing the potential of machine learning in understanding celestial phenomena.

  <h2>TensorFlow Regression Challenge</h2>
</div>


The purpose of this project is to create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores). The hope here is to give further insight into the graduate admissions process to improve test prep strategy. This model resulted in an MSE score of 0.0044 and an MAE score of 0.0505.
