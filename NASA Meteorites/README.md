## Project Synopsis

In this project, we explored an open-source dataset from NASA, hosted on Kaggle, encompassing all known meteorite discoveries up until 2014. This exploration unearthed some fascinating insights into the characteristics and distribution of meteorites across the globe, particularly highlighting the peculiar traits of relict meteorites—ancient meteorites significantly larger than their counterparts and found predominantly in specific locales, such as the cold, arid regions near the Earth's poles, including the Northern Baltics and Antarctic areas. The clustering of these ancient meteorites in such distinct regions sparked curiosity about the underlying causes of their preservation and distribution patterns. My background in physics and geology led me to theorize that certain conditions—such as specific soil types, minimal wind exposure, and perpetual ice cover—create an ideal preservation environment by minimizing erosion.

The culmination of this project was the development of an advanced XGBoost Regression model designed to predict future meteorite impacts through time series analysis. The model demonstrated exceptional performance, as evidenced by its validation scores:

- Mean Absolute Error: 0.81
- Mean Squared Error: 0.65
- MAE Variance Accountability: 0.000225

These metrics attest to the high accuracy and reliability of the predictive model. Additionally, the alignment of the model's predictions with actual data from NASA underscores its potential utility in forecasting meteorite impacts.

This project not only provided unique insights into the distribution and characteristics of meteorites but also highlighted the potential of machine learning techniques in advancing our understanding of these celestial objects. The findings serve as a stepping stone for future research, opening avenues for collaboration with experts in the field to further unravel the mysteries of meteorites. As we continue to explore these ancient visitors from space, we edge closer to unlocking the secrets of our universe, underscoring the importance of interdisciplinary research in expanding the frontiers of knowledge.
